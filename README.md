#Student Registration System



-This project is about a simple registration system for students which are enrolled in the subject CMSC 11

- It has Password Encryption in order for the some functions to be only limited to some user
- It has two modes which are the admin and the student. In the admin you can basically do everything while on student mode the user can only view subjects, enroll in them, drop them and update their record.
- You can also import a list of students and subjects but when importing a student with an unknown subject enrolled in the program asks the user if he wants to create that subject or import from masterlist or exit where the unknown subject will just be saved as none
- The user if on admin mode has also a delete all function and the admin can also update subject records and all of the student records 
- The admin user name is "admin" and the password is "admin" as for the student, his/her username is her Student ID and her password is his/her lastname
- The project is made out entirely of c language and uses only the stdio.h header in the back end part while the other headers are for the user-friendly GUI
- The Project uses structs and pointers as well as different functions made by the programmers
- Download all the files and enjoy!
