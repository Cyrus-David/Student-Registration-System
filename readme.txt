This code is our final project in Computer Science 11 in University of Philippines under Ms. Naressa Belle Saripada. My groupmates are, Joshua G. Sanico and Carl Michael Valde. 

The basic features of SRS are the following:

1. Create, Update and Delete Student Records.
2. Display list of all student records.
3. Export masterlist and save as .csv file .
4. Enrol or Drop a subject (maximum of 3 subjects per student)
5. Search Student Record
6. Create, Update and Delete Subject.
7. Search Subject

Extra Features:

•Security Log-in

•	Two user options(Admin and Student Log-in) 

•	Delete all function(with security confirmation) 

•	Search subjects with substrings

•	Case insensitive 

•	Can search students through name(substring will include students with the same name) 

•	Update subjects and student specifically

•	Interactive and simple GUI 

•	Import student and when the student is not enrolled in cmsc11, it will ask confirmation to enroll the student. The slot is limited so, when the student has already enrolled in three subjects, he won't be added to the enrolled list. 

•	When enrolling a student and he/she is enrolled in an unknown subject there is an option of making the said subject. When making the subject and it is different from the said subject, it will ask again for the subject code. Not making the subject will still enroll the student although it would be without the unknown subject. 

•	Time complexity is enhanced through minimal use of headers. 

•	It can read directly from any directory. 

•	Importing the same subjects will only accept one. (The scan depends on the Subject Code and Subject ID.)
